		sng -- a compiler for an editable PNG representation

SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed to
reflect the data and structure of PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
files in an editable form.

The sng program translates between SNG and PNG.  It can be useful
especially for editing data in obscure ancillary chanks that graphics
editors won't handle.
