Description: enable lossless editing of PNGs via a textual representation
 SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed
 specifically to represent the entire contents of a PNG (Portable
 Network Graphics) file in an editable form.  Thus, SNGs representing
 elaborate graphics images and ancillary chunk data can be readily
 generated or modified using only text tools.
.
 SNG is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that losslessly
 translates between SNG and PNG.
.
 sng is production-ready, and has been tested on all 155 of the
 non-broken images in the png test suite.
.
 Downloads are available from SNG's <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sng/">SourceForge page</a>.
