1. Multiline strings in SNG.

2. Clean up and regularize the syntax.

3. Make the -i option work

4. Find out why tRNS causes a CRC error

I'd like to see the row filters in there.  That would permit you
to save and restore without having to do the filtering algorithm
and would allow you to preserve particularly well-compressed data;
all you'd need to do is inflate and deflate.  Also I'd like to  
see the rows separated into structures with
{decimal row_number, decimal filter, base64|hex pixels}:

Image: {
   base64
   {0,  0,  3333333...},
   {1,  0,  3333333...},
   (2,  0,  0000011...),
   [...]
   {18, 0,  3333333...}
 }

You might also allow decimal pixel data, which would have to be delimited
with white space or commas: (0, 0, 3 3 3 3 3 ....)

Alternatively, you could write the pixel data in netpbm ASCII format and
the filters separately:

Filters: {000000000000000}
Image: {
  netbpm
{
P2 18 18 255
3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
... 3 3 3 3 3 3
}

That way you could just yank a PGM or PPM right into the SNG with
a text editor.
