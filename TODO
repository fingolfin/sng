			To-do list:

Author's tasked:

1. Multiline strings in SNG.
2. Real safeprint, and string escape handling.
3. Clean up and regularize the syntax.
4. Make the -i option work.
5. Find out why tRNS causes a CRC error

Suitable tasks for someone other than the author:

6. Add netpbm as a supported data literal format, in addition to the
   current string and base64 hex.

7. At the moment, the code assumes that double and float fields 
   in the info structure have the PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
   representation.  Conditionalize the code suitably.  Also add properly
   conditionalized code so that everything still work with only
   fixed-point (PNG_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED) enabled.
